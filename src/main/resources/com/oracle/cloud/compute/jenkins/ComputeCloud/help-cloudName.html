  A name that uniquely identifies this cloud amongst other Oracle Compute
  Cloud configurations.  This name is stored with the nodes that are provisioned
  by this cloud, and it is used by the nodes to obtain Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic
  Service connection details.  If the cloud name is changed while there are
  associated nodes, Jenkins will no longer be able to manage the corresponding
  orchestration in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic Service.
