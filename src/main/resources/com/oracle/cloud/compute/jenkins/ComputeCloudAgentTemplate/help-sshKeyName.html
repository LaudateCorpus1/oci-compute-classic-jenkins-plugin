  To allow the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic plugin to access an instance using SSH,
  generate at least one SSH key pair and upload the SSH public key that should
  be associated with the instance to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic Service.  Select the
  SSH key name and enter the SSH private key, and the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic
  plugin will use this SSH key pair to access the instances it creates.<br>
  Note that you don't have to provide public key name if you are using a custom image and have already stored the public key in the image.<br>
